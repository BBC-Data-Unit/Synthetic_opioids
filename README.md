# Synthetic_opioids

In March 2024, [we reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68479491) criticism the UK government was behind the curve in tracking the spread of new super-strength drugs.

We found more than 100 deaths had been linked to synthetic opioids called nitazenes betwwen June 2023 and February 2024, through data obtained from the National Crime Agency.

Dr Mark Pucci, a doctor who had treated a number of patients who had taken the drugs, said flawed data collection methods meant the numbers were likely to be a significant underestimate.

In the week of publication, the UK government made 15 synthetic opioids Class A drugs.

Our story on the BBC website featured interviews with two people recovering from heroin addictions who had overdosed after unwittingly taking nitazenes.

## Background

The National Crime Agency (NCA) believed nitazenes were being produced in illicit labs in China and were entering the UK through the Royal Mail and other parcel operators.

It said in most cases, they were then cut and mixed with heroin by organised gangs, strengthening the drugs being sold on the street.

They had also been found in samples of illegal diazepam tablets, most likely bought online.

Diazepam - also known by one of its brand names, Valium - was a class-C drug in the UK,  commonly used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms and seizures. It was illegal to possess without a prescription.

The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) told the BBC it was concerned about nitazenes in "fake medicines". 

Alongside law enforcement agencies, DHSC had joined a cross-government taskforce to lead the response.

Critics, however, said the authorities had not acted fast enough to track non-fatal overdoses involving nitazenes.

* The most recently-updated figures for deaths linked to nitazenes from 1 June 2023-22 February 2024 through post-mortem toxicology results, according to the National Crime Agency (NCA)
* Deaths linked to nitazenes from 1 June 2023-31 December 2023 through post-mortem toxicology results, according to the National Crime Agency(NCA)
* Non-fatal overdoses associated with confirmed nitazenes from 1 June 2023-31 December 2023 as recorded by the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities(OHID)
* All suspected opioid non-fatal overdoses tracked from 1 June 2023-31 December 2023 as recorded by the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities(OHID)

The data from OHID was obtained by the BBC Shared Data Unit after requesting an internal review of an FOI response that was initially a refusal.
