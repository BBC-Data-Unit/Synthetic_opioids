# Synthetic_opioids

In March 2024, we looked at the UK government's response to the spread of new super-strength drugs.

We found more than 100 deaths had been linked to synthetic opioids called nitazenes betwwen June 2023 and February 2024, through data obtained from the National Crime Agency.

Dr Mark Pucci, a doctor who had treated a number of patients who had taken the drugs, said flawed data collection methods meant the numbers were likely to be a significant underestimate.

In the week of publication, the UK government made 15 synthetic opioids Class A drugs.

Our story on the BBC website featured interviews with a former drug user and a current drug user who had overdosed on nitazenes.

## Background

The National Crime Agency (NCA) believes nitazenes are produced in illicit labs in China and are entering the UK through the Royal Mail and other parcel operators.

In most cases, they are then cut and mixed with heroin by organised gangs, strengthening the drugs being sold on the street.

They have also been found in samples of illegal diazepam tablets, most likely bought online.

Diazepam - also known by one of its brand names, Valium - is a class-C drug in the UK,  commonly used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms and seizures. It is illegal to possess without a prescription.

The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) told the BBC it was concerned about nitazenes in "fake medicines". 

Alongside law enforcement agencies, DHSC has joined a cross-government taskforce to lead the response.

Critics, however, say the authorities have not acted fast enough to track non-fatal overdoses involving nitazenes.

## What we shared

We shared a story pack, complete with a detailed background, methodology and expert comment.

Interviews in the pack included: 

* Dr Mark Pucci - a consultant in clinical toxicology in Birmingham and Sandwell.
* Dr Judith Yates - a GP from Birmingham who collates data about drug deaths in the city, where several deaths linked to nitazenes took place in 2023.
* Vicki Markiewicz - executive director for the charity Change Grow Live

  The pack also included a right of response from the Department for Health and Social Care.

## Get the data

In our accompanying Google Sheet, we shared the following data broken by region:

* The most recently-updated figures for deaths linked to nitazenes from 1 June 2023-22 February 2024 through post-mortem toxicology results, according to the National Crime Agency (NCA)
* Deaths linked to nitazenes from 1 June 2023-31 December 2023 through post-mortem toxicology results, according to the National Crime Agency(NCA)
* Non-fatal overdoses associated with confirmed nitazenes from 1 June 2023-31 December 2023 as recorded by the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities(OHID)
* All suspected opioid non-fatal overdoses tracked from 1 June 2023-31 December 2023 as recorded by the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities(OHID)

The data from OHID was obtained by the BBC Shared Data Unit after requesting an internal review of an FOI response that was initially a refusal.
